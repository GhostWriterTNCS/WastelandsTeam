\section{Data Storage and Access}
Project data are stored on a private git repository:\\
	\textit{git@pong.di.unimi.it:GLD/18/teamdellelande}

The repository structure follows the good pratices of GitFlow.

The history graph can become very complex; in order to avoid that, you have to work with two type of branch:
\begin{itemize}
	\item branch with infinite lifetime
	\item branch with finite lifetime
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Branch with infinite lifetime}
They are the main branches of the project. There are two different infinite lifetime branches:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{master}: this branch contains the last project review locked down by the project responsible.
    
  Only with the last version on master it can be done the \textit{level design to art handoff}.
  
  You have not to do any commit/merge in this branch unless the project responsibles agree that the current version can be \textit{locked-down}.
  
\item \textbf{develop}: This branch is the development branch. Each one has to work and make his own changes to it.
  
  When you think you had made a good change, you have to do a commit inside here so other can use it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Branch with finite lifetime}
You work on them just for a certain period and then you have to delete them.

You have to work on one at a time.

When you want to add a new content you have not to work on develop branch.

You have to create a your temporary branch where you can work and only when you have finished it
you have to merge your branch with the \textit{develop} branch.

You will never use more this branch so delete it. When you will want to add new content you have to make a new branch e so on. 

\subsection*{Synthesis}
When you work on a new content, you have to work on temporary branch and when you finish you have to merge your commit with the develop branch.\\
\textit{New content? New branch}.\\
\textit{Work completed? New merge with develop}.\\
And so on.

\subsection*{Revision history}
Whenever you make a commit or a merge with the \textit{develop} branch, you must add a comment about your work in the revision history file: \path{./Documents/revisionHistory.tex}.

\subsection{Data access and permissions}
Only \textit{editors} are allowed to add and edit files, according to the following table.

Only the \textit{owners} can enable new \textit{editors}.

Everybody can read all the files.

Rules are sorted by priority: first rule has the highest priority and overwrites the other.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|l|X|}
\hline
\cellcolor{lightgray}\textbf{Files} & \cellcolor{lightgray}\textbf{Owner} & \cellcolor{lightgray}\textbf{Editors} \\ \hline
\path{./Documents/Images/SVG/*} & Davide Valentini & Davide Valentini \\ \hline
\path{./Documents/Images/Characters/*} & Francesco Principe & Francesco Principe \\ \hline
\path{./Documents/Images/Logos/*} & Francesco Periti & Francesco Periti \\ \hline
\path{./Documents/*.tex} & Francesco Principe & Every member of the Wastelands Team \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

To avoid nonsense image-merge nobody can add/edited image in any directories unless he was the directory owner and the directory was a subdirectory of Images.

\subsection{Backup}
There are daily backups on three different machines in three different locations.
Responsibles:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Francesco Periti} for Piacenza
	\item \textbf{Francesco Principe} for Parma
	\item \textbf{Davide Valentini} for Milan
\end{itemize}

\section{Directory Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\path{./Documents}}: contains all files used for the current level design document. Each subfolder but \textit{Images} matches a chapter of the Level Design Document.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/levelDesignDocument.tex}}: this is the current level-design-document file. It contains references to the LaTeX files that compose it.

    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/Characters}}: this directory contains all the LaTeX files about the characters.

    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/Images}}: this directory contains every useful image for the documentation.

    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/Story}}: this directory contains all the LaTeX files about the story.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\path{./dataManagmentDocument.tex}}: this is the current data-managment-document file. It contains all technical features and rules to work on the project.
\end{itemize}

To add notes or comments to a file, create a txt file with the same name in the same folder.

\section{File Naming Convention}
%During the project development has to be respected the following conventions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The name of each directory and each file has to be significant and homogeneous.
  \item The name of each file has to begin with a lowercase character. Each time you want to separate two words within a file name, you have not to add a space between them but you have to make the first character of the second word uppercase: \textit{fileNameExample.ext}
  \item The name of each folder has to begin with a uppercase character. Each time you want to separate two words within a directory name, you have not to add a space between them but you have to make the first character of the second word uppercase: \textit{FolderNameExample}
   \item Files named \textit{index.tex} are used as containers, they connect all the other files inside the current directory.
\end{itemize}
