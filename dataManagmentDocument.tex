\section{Data Storage and Access}
Project data are stored on a private git repository.

The repository structure follows the good pratices of GitFlow.

The history graph can become very complex; in order to avoid that, you have to work with two type of branch:
\begin{itemize}
\item branch with infinite lifetime;
\item branch with finite lifetime;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Branch with infinite lifetime}
They are the main branch of the project. There are two different branches:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{master}:\\
  this branch contains %the deployed project version%
  the last project review locked down by the project responsables.
    
  Only with the last version on master it can be done \textit{the level design to art handoff}.
  
  You have not to do any commit/merge in this branch unless the project responsables agree that the current version can be \textit{lock-down}.
\item \textbf{develop}:\\
  This branch is the development branch. Each have to work and make own changes to it.
  
  When you think you had made a good change, you have to do a commit it inside here so other can use it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Branch with finite lifetime}
You work on them just for a certain period and then you have to delete them.

You have to work on one at a time.

When you want to add a new content you have not to work on develop branch.

You have to create a your temporary branch where you can work and only when you have finished it
you have to merge your branch with the \textit{develop} branch.

You will never use more this branch so delete it. When you will want to add new content you have to make a new branch e so on. 

\subsection*{Synthesis}
When you work on a new content, you have to work on temporary branch and when you finish you have to merge your commit with the develop branch.\\
\textit{New content? New branch}.\\
\textit{Work completed? New merge with develop}.\\
And so on.


Only \textbf{editors} are allowed to add new files and edit existent ones. You can find the list of allowed editors for a folder in the file \textbf{!AdminAndEditors.txt} in the corresponding folder. If absent, refer to the same file in parent folder.

Only \textbf{admins} are allowed to add new editors. You can find the list of admins for a folder in the file \textbf{!AdminAndEditors.txt} in the corresponding folder. If absent, refer to the same file in parent folder.

\subsection{Backup}
There are daily backups on three different machines in three different locations.
Responsibles:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Francesco Periti} for Piacenza
	\item \textbf{Francesco Principe} for Parma
	\item \textbf{Davide Valentini} for Milan
\end{itemize}

\section{Directory Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\path{./Documents}}: contains all files used for the current level design document. Each subfolder but \textit{Images} matches a chapter of the Level Design Document.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/levelDesignDocument.tex}}: this is the current level-design-document file. It contains references to the LaTeX files that compose it.

    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/Characters}}: this directory contains all the LaTeX files about the characters.

    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/Images}}: this directory contains every useful image for the documentation.

    \item \textbf{\path{./Documents/Story}}: this directory contains all the LaTeX files about the story.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\path{./dataManagmentDocument.tex}}: this is the current data-managment-document file. It contains all technical features and rules to work on the project.
\end{itemize}

To add notes or comments to a file, create a txt file with the same name in the same folder.

\section{File Naming Convention}
During the project development has to be respected the following conventions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The name of each directory and each file has to be significant and homogeneous.
  \item The name of each file has to begin with a lowercase character. Each time you want to separate two words within a file name, you have not to add a space between them but you have to make the first character of the second word uppercase: \textit{fileNameExample.ext}
  \item The name of each file has to begin with a uppercase character. Each time you want to separate two words within a directory name, you have not to add a space between them but you have to make the first character of the second word uppercase: \textit{FolderNameExample}
   \item Files named \textit{index.tex} are used as containers, they connect all the other files inside the current directory
\end{itemize}
