\subsection{Description}
He is a djinn who spends his days meditating and practicing with new spells. He loves being helpful for people who actually need his help.

\subsection{Background story}
He decided to move many decades ago into the desert because he felt like the society he was living in was too selfish and asked him for help only for futile things.

Nowadays, no one knows him personally but people in the south of Ingary think, according to a common legend, that he still lives alone in the desert and he helps people when they are really in trouble.
