\subsection{Description}
Before being refused, she was the court magician at castle of Ingary. Since she left the castle, she doesn't have any other interest except avenging the humiliation suffered from the king.

She aims to become the most powerful Djinn of the kingdom because she wants to take revenge of the King of Ingary. According to this, she is willing to do anything to make the war go on.

\subsection{Background story}
Years ago she worked as court magician for the king of Ingary. She fell in love with the king and she declared her love to him, but he rejected her because she is 200-years-old djinn. She felt sad and humiliated and decided to go away.

She tore out her heart with a spell in order to end her suffering and hid it in a dormant volcano on Kazan island. This increased his hatred and desire for revenge.

She became the court magician of Strangia and she used another spell to charm the king of Strangia and manipulate him. She married the king and they declare war against Ingary.
