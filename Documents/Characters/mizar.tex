A long time ago she worked as court magician of the Kingdom of Ingary. She fell in love with the King she declared her love to him, but without the expected results. In fact, the King mocked her and told her he could never love a djinn. She felt humiliated and decided to make him pay for it. She tore out her heart with a spell in order to end her suffering and hid it in a secret place. This act increased his hatred and desire for revenge. Using another spell she charms the king of Strangia and she tricks him in marrying her.
