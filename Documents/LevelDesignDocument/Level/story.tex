\section{Story}

When Sophie and Calcifer arrive in Dynamia it is late afternoon. They find themselves in a dead end in the suburbs of Dynamia.

Calcifer: What’s this smell!?

They move on to a street crossed by a canal.

\extslug[afternoon]{Dynamia}

The camera  moves around Sophie to show streets and canals. 

\begin{dialogue}[amazed]{Sophie}
This city is so beautiful!
\end{dialogue}

The camera rises up to show the city, suggesting them the possible paths and, eventually,  zooming on the location of the castle. The camera rotates and returns behind Sophie's shoulders. 

\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Calcifer}
Look how much water! Be careful! Don’t let me fall!
\end{dialogue}
\end{screenplay}

Sophie (discouraged): Dynamia is so big! Where Howl could be?

Calcifer: I can’t feel his magic. He could be anywhere.

Sophie (resolute): We need information. We can try to find some at the market. 

[An indicator appears in the map.]

Calcifer: Okay. Do you think that they sell also a little bit of wood?

Sophie sees a manifest representing a dark-skinned woman with a crown. She can talk to it.

Sophie: Hello, maniffst. Who is this woman?

Manifest (solemn): She is our enlightened and beloved Queen regent. Long live the Queen!

Sophie and Calcifer go to the market. There are two guards on their way.

Sophie: Some guards! Better not be seen.

They move past the guards and they reach the market, which is located in a huge crowded square. They can hear the buzz of the crowd and the shouting of the merchants in the background
