\section{Story}

\textit{In the story writing it has been used the screenplay format to highlight the cutscenes.}\\\\

When Sophie and Calcifer arrive in Dynamia it is late afternoon. They find themselves in a dead end in the suburbs of Dynamia.

\textbf{Calcifer (disgusted)}: What’s this smell!?

They exit from the dead end moving on to a street crossed by a canal. They can hear the noise of the water on their way.

\begin{screenplay}
\extslug[afternoon]{Dynamia}

The camera  moves around Sophie to show streets and canals. 

\begin{dialogue}[amazed]{Sophie}
This city is so beautiful!
\end{dialogue}

The camera rises up to show the city, suggesting the possible paths and, eventually,  zooming on the location of the castle. The camera rotates and returns behind Sophie's shoulders. 

\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Calcifer}
Look how much water! Be careful! Don’t let me fall!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[discouraged]{Sophie}
Dynamia is so big! Where Howl could be?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Calcifer}
I can’t feel his magic. He could be anywhere.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[resolute]{Sophie}
We need information. We may start to ask someone.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Calcifer}
Yes, you're right. Hey, look over there.
\end{dialogue}

On the way, Sophie sees a panel with a map of the city.

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Hello, map. We're looking for a friend of ours. Where can we find some information?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[tired]{Map}
Whaaaat? Meeeee?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Yes, please. Where can we find some people to talk with?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[tired]{Map}
Mmh, let me thiiiiink... Yeeees, I knoooow the riiiight plaaaace. Goooo to the maaaarket. Right heeeere.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Thank you very much. Bye bye.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[tired]{Map}

\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}

Sophie and Calcifer go to the market. There are two guards on their way.

\textbf{Sophie}: Some guards! Better not be noticed.

They move past the guards and they reach the market, which is located in a huge crowded square where they can hear the buzz of the crowd and the shouting of the merchants in the background.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sophie arrives at the stand in the market pointed by the indicator and finds a merchant that sells fabrics and accessories.
Sophie buys a bit of wool to make new hats.

\end{dialogue}
  
\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Sophie}

\end{dialogue}
    
\begin{dialogue}{Merchant}
Obviously, in the prison of the castle. But be careful! The castle is surveilled everywhere by many guards, except for the west wall because they think it is too high for anyone, but, maybe, not for you...
\end{dialogue}
    
\begin{dialogue}[hasty]{Sophie}
Okay, okay thank you! I have to go!!
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}

\begin{dialogue}{Guards}
Hey, where are you going?
\end{dialogue}

Sophie has to go back.

\end{screenplay}

\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Can 2}
Or some tuna?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Sophie}

Howl?

He has been defeated by the queen regent and he has been imprisoned in the spirits realm.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Calcifer}
Oh no, I knew he was in danger.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
My poor Howl! I’m so frightened for him. Wait, where do you say he is?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Box 2}
The spirits realm.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Box 1}
Or something like that.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Where is it?
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Can 1}
We don’t know.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Can 2}
We are just cans!
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Ok, ok. Thank you very much. Now we have to go.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Sack 1}
Watch out for the queen regent.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Box 1}
And the guards!
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{Can 1}
And the demons!

Sophie and Calcifer see the captain of the guards. He is bigger than the other guards and he has a strong and dreadful magic aura. Upon the walls there are plants and high grass where Sophie and Calcifer can hide.

The captain creates a fireball and throws it against the vegetation. The plants and the grass burns instantly, it remains and empty ashy spot.

\begin{dialogue}[at low voice]{Sophie}
Oh, no. He's terrifying.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{screenplay}
\intslug[afternoon]{Castle of Dynamia, prison}

\begin{dialogue}[surprised and worried]{Justin}
Sophie! Calcifer! Guys, what are you doing here!? It is so dangerous!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
We are here to help you. You'll be executed tomorrow!
\end{dialogue}

Sophie unlocks the cell and Justin is free.

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Now let's go, we must hurry.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Justin}
Wait, there is another way. You don't know it, but this castle is full of secret passages.

\begin{dialogue}{Justin}
Let's use a gondola.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[scared]{Calcifer}
WHAT! You wanna use that scary thing?!
\end{dialogue}

They jump on a gondola.

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Justin, do you know how to drive it?
\end{dialogue}

Justin picks up an oar.

\begin{dialogue}{Justin}
Ehm... not really.
\end{dialogue}

Two guards get close to them.

\begin{dialogue}{Guard 1}
Hey what are you doing?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[screaming]{Guard 2}
What? The prince is free! Pull the alarm! The prisoner is running!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Calcifer}
Sophie, use your magic!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[in a hurry]{Sophie}
Please, move, gondola. We need to go.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Gondola}
Hello, Sophie. Tell me where you want to go and I will take you there. I’m yours to command.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[in a hurry]{Sophie}
That way! Go that way!
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}
\vspace{1em}

The gondola starts moving and Sophie guides it through the city, careful to avoid the guards and the demons.

They dock near the dead end where is placed the secret passage for the flying castle. They go there and pass through the door.
