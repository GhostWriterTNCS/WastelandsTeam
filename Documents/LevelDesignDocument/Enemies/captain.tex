\subsubsection{Description and background story}
The captain was, without any doubt, the strongest and scariest man who ever joined the guards and, due to this, Mizar has chosen him for one of her experiments. Given his extreme faith, loyalty and submission to the queen, the captain immediately accepted her offer and so Mizar blended him with one of her demons making him even stronger, scarier and faster. He is the boss of the level "In the enemy territory" and attack any intruder as soon as he sees them.
