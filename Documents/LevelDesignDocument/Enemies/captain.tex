\subsubsection{Description and background story}
The captain was, without any doubt, the strongest and scariest man who ever joined the guards and, due to this, Mizar has chosen him for one of her experiments. Given his extreme faith, loyalty and submission to the queen, the captain immediately accepted her offer and so Mizar blended him with one of her demons making him even stronger and scarier.

He is the boss of the level "In the enemy territory" and attack any intruder as soon as he sees them.

The captain has two attacks: Magic claw and Fireball.

The Magic claw is a melee attack that scratches Sophie. It is a more powerful version of the demons' Claw attack. When attacking, the claws of his right hand glow with purple light and leave a trial of the same color that stands for two seconds.

The Fireball is a ranged attack. The captain creates a fireball between his hands and then he throws it with his right hand against the target.
