\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Patrolling}: the guard roams around in its area and looks around.
	\item \textbf{Alerted}: the guard moves towards the noise source and looks around for the player.
	\item \textbf{Fighting}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Close}: the guard hits the player and goes away from him/her.
		\item \textbf{Short range}: the guard attacks the player (short range attack).
		\item \textbf{Medium range}: the guard attacks the player (medium range attack).
		\item \textbf{Long range}: the guard moves towards the player.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Defeated}: the guard falls down confused.
\end{itemize}

When the guard hits Sophie, it doesn't cause any damage, but stuns her for a moment (just to prevent the player from keep chasing the guard).

When attacking, the guard chambers a round and shots against Sophie. The arquebus has a recoil and makes a small cloud of smoke from the barrel.
