The story is set in a extended version of the world presented in the movie which includes some elements taken from the books and some brand-new elements. In particular, we are going to talk about a race and some places that are never mentioned in the movie but we consider them as if they have been always existing.

%The story is set in an alternative universe, in a unspecified region of the Earth, where humans, magicians and djiins live.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Humans}: the most common race. They live in contact with magicians.

	\item \textbf{Magicians}: humans with magic powers. They are less common than humans.

	\item \textbf{Djiins}: this race is so rare that it is considered like a legend. They are a long-living race, incredibly powerful and skilled in magic.
\end{itemize}

Everybody speaks the same language and lives according to the norms of civilized countries.

The atmosphere in the region resembles that of Japan in the early 1900s and it is organized in many different kingdoms.

Each king holds a court magician who helps him in the political and military affairs.

%Although the region seems safe and quiet, 

The Kingdom of Ingary is at war with the near Kingdom of Strangia. The war is fighted by soldiers and wizards.

%The current war is fighted by soldiers and wizards, called to duty by the court magicians on behalf of the kings.
