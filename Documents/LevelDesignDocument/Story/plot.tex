\section{Plot}

\subsection*{Prologue}
Sophie has discovered she is a witch and she is learning how to talk with objects, but she is still a beginner.

Suddenly Suliman sends Howl on a mission in order to understand the reasons why the war between Kingsbury and Strangia has not already ceased.

\subsection*{Act 1 (levels 1 and 2)}
Weeks after Howl's departure, Sophie begins getting worried for him because the war is still going on and they haven't heard from him for three weeks.

She goes visiting Suliman and ask her for some information about Howl and the mission he is carrying on. Suliman tells her that Howl has gone to Dynamia, the capital of Strangia, but she lost communication with him three weeks ago too.

Sophie wants to leave to help Howl, but Suliman discourages her because it is very dangerous. Sophie doesn't care because she cannot stand still while Howl is danger. In order to help Sophie in some way, Suliman gives her a magical ring.

Sophie goes back to the flying castle and tells her friends what she has discovered.

\subsection*{Act 2 (levels 3...6)}
Returned to the flying castle, Sophie puts Calcifer in the magic lantern crafted by Howl and she uses the magic door to reach Dynamia.

While they are roaming through the city they find out that their friend Justin, the prince of Strangia, has been imprisoned by the queen regent because he has come back from Ingary asking to end the war, but he has been thought to be secretly a friend of the king of Ingary and so he has been accused of high treason. 

Using their abilities, Sophie and Calcifer enter the castle of Dynamia and they reach the prison. They find the brig where Justin is imprisoned and they free him.

The three of them escape from the fortress and they head to Kingsbury, now under attack. Here Justin reveals to Suliman that the regent is Mizar and Sophie says to Suliman that the objects in the castle of Dynamia told her that Howl is imprisoned in the spirits realm. Suliman is not able to send Sophie to the spirits realm, only djinns can, so Suliman tells Sophie about a legendary old djinn who is told to live in the Southern desert.

Hoping the legend is true, Sophie and Calcifer use the castle to fly towards the Southern desert until they find Belzel. They explain to him that one of their friends is trapped inside the spirits realm, so he accepts to help them and he opens a portal.

Sophie and Calcifer enter into the spirits realm, they explore it and overcome Mizar's demons until they find Howl. They manage to free him and go back to Earth.

\subsection*{Act 3 (level 7)}
Once back, Howl uses the black door to see Mizar's past and uncover the hideout of her heart. They see that Mizar is inside the dormant volcano of Kazan island. She has been rejected by the king of Ingary and she has run away from Kingsbury. She tore out her heart in order not to suffer anymore and, by this way, she has become evil and she has decided to destroy the kingdom of Ingary.

They get to Kazan island, where Mizar hid her heart, and they overcome her demon guards until they reach the bowels of the volcano. There appears Mizar, so Howl and Calcifer begin to fight her. In the meantime, Sophie picks up the heart and Mizar becomes suddenly vulnerable. Sophie has now two choices:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Giving the heart to Howl}: Howl destroys it and Mizar dies.
\item \textit{Giving the heart to Mizar}: Mizar's shriveled heart starts to beat again and she realizes what she has done. She feels guilty and scared and she runs away wondering about what she really wants.
\end{itemize} 

The war ends and Sophie, Calcifer and Howl can go back home. Justin becomes the new king of Strangia.
