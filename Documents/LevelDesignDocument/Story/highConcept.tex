\section{Premises}

The story is a sequel of the movie \textit{Howlâ€™s Moving Castle}, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and there are some references to the book \textit{Castle in the Air} by Diana Wynne Jones.

Given that, it is recommended to the player to watch the movie to deeply understand the relationships and the lore at best but, nevertheless, it is not mandatory because it is a brand new story which will introduce new characters, new places and new adventures.
