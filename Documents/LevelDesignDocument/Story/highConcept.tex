\section{High concept}

The story is a sequel of the movie \textit{Howlâ€™s Moving Castle}, directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and there are some references to the book \textit{Castle in the Air} by Diana Wynne Jones.

Given that, it is recommended to the player to watch the movie to deeply understand the relationships and the lore at best but, nevertheless, it is not mandatory watching the movie nor read the book because it is a brand new story which will introduce new characters, new places and new adventures.

This is a story about a brave girl and his fire demon friend who will pass through many difficulties to save their dear. They will have to face a vengeful djinn and many other obstacles and they will have to use their intelligence or fight, they will have to explore new places, they  will have to use their magical powers to go on till they they complete their mission.
