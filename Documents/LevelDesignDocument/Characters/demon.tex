\subsubsection{Description}
Demons have been summoned by Mizar to help the guards in their duty. They are extremely obedient and loyal to the queen. They play an important role, patrolling high risk zones as the prisons and, even if they cannot attack from the distance, they are really fast and they can close the gap with any fugitive in a brief time.
