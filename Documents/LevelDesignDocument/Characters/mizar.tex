\subsection{Description}
Before being refused, she was the court magician at the castle of Ingary. She left because of the the humiliation suffered from the king.

After she tears out her heart off, she aims to destroy Ingary because she wants to take revenge on the king. According to this, she is willing to do anything to make the war go on. The heart is also her weak point and she is nearly invincible until her heart is in safe.

\subsection{Background story}
Years ago she worked as court magician for the king of Ingary. She fell in love with the king and she declared her love to him, but he rejected her because she is 200-years-old djinn. She felt sad and humiliated and decided to go away.

She tore out her heart with a spell in order to end her suffering and hid it in a dormant volcano on Kazan island. This increased her hatred and desire for revenge.

She became the court magician of Strangia and she used another spell to charm the king of Strangia and manipulate him. She married the king and they declare war against Ingary.
