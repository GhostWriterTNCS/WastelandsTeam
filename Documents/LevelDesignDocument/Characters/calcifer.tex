\subsection{Description}
Calcifer always plays the part of a gruff and proud one, but in reality he is a good and loyal friend for both Howl and Sophie, even after the contract has been broken. In fact he does whatever he can to help them in every situation and he is one the most willing to go and save Howl.

Howl created a magic lantern that allows him to safely leave the flying castle, so he can help Sophie during her journey. The lantern has four legs, so he can also move autonomously.

He protects Sophie during their journey and he is always ready to fight, but he is not reckless and he always respects her decisions. He can use debris to build machines that allow him and Sophie to overcome some obstacles.

\subsection{Background story}
Calcifer was a falling star who made a contract with Howl and became a fire demon. After the contract has been broken, he decided to stay with his friends.
