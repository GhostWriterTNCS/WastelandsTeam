\section{Secondary objectives}
In addition to the main mission, the player can carry on some optional missions that expand some elements of the main story and reveal more details about the world itself.

In order to help the player finding the starting point of the secondary missions, around the city there are some couple of NPCs that are talking each other. When the player is closer than 50 meters to those NPCs, one of them points to the starting point of the nearest secondary mission, even if its dialogue is not related to it.

When the player is closer than 200 meters to an NPC that is involved in a secondary mission, that NPC is highlighted with an exclamation mark.
