\section{Story}

\textit{In the story writing it has been used the screenplay format to highlight the cutscenes.}\\\\

When Sophie and Calcifer arrive in Dynamia it is late afternoon. They find themselves in a dead end in the southern area of Dynamia.

\textbf{Calcifer (disgusted)}: What's this smell!?

They exit from the dead end moving on to a street crossed by a canal. They can hear the noise of the water on their way.

\begin{screenplay}
\extslug[afternoon]{Dynamia}

The camera rotates around Sophie to show streets and canals. 

\begin{dialogue}[amazed]{Sophie}
This city is so beautiful!
\end{dialogue}

The camera rises up to show the city, suggesting the possible paths. In the distance there is the Castle of Dynamia. The camera rotates and returns behind Sophie's shoulders. 

\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Calcifer}
Look how much water! Be careful! Don't let me fall!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[discouraged]{Sophie}
Dynamia is so big! Where Howl could be?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Calcifer}
I can't feel his magic. He could be anywhere.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[resolute]{Sophie}
We need information. We may start to ask someone.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Calcifer}
Yes, you're right. Hey, look over there.
\end{dialogue}

On the way, Sophie sees a panel with a map of the city. She reaches it.

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Hello, map. We're looking for a friend of ours. Where can we find some information?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[tired]{Map}
Whaaaat? Meeeee?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Yes, please. Where can we find some people to talk with?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[tired]{Map}
Mmmmh, let me thiiiiink... Yeeees, I knoooow the riiiight plaaaace. Goooo to the maaaarket. Right heeeere.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Thank you very much. Bye bye.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[tired]{Map}
Byeeee!
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}
\vspace{1em}

Sophie and Calcifer go to the market. There are two guards on their way.

\textbf{Sophie}: Some guards! Better not be noticed.

They move past the guards and they reach the market, which is located in a huge crowded square where they can hear the buzz of the crowd and the shouting of the merchants in the background.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sophie arrives at the stand in the market pointed by the indicator and finds a merchant that sells fabrics and accessories.
Sophie buys a bit of wool to make new hats.

\textbf{Sophie (thinking)}: This will be perfect for my hats!

\begin{screenplay}
\extslug[afternoon]{Dynamia, market}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
How affairs are going on? Do you have problems due to war?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[resigned]{Merchant}
Sure, like any other merchant here. What about you? What a lonely girl is doing here?
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}

\textit{\textbf{CHOICE}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lie}
  
\begin{screenplay}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
I work out of city, it is very hard there too. I hope the war will end soon.
\end{dialogue}
  
\begin{dialogue}[low level voice]{Merchant}
Be careful, the guards could hear you. \\
\hspace{4em}(normal level voice) \\
The prince Justin was imprisoned for this cause.
\end{dialogue}
  
\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Sophie}
Imprisoned? Where? 
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Merchant}
Obviously in the castle. Why are you so worried? Are you in league with the prince? Guards!!!!
\end{dialogue}

  Two guards comes to the market but Sophie runs away before they can even get there and sows them easily.

\end{screenplay}
  
\item \textbf{Bribe him}
  
\begin{screenplay}

\begin{dialogue}[persuasive]{Sophie}
I'm a foreigner. May you give me some information about a wizard from Ingary who came here few weeks ago? I can pay you.
\end{dialogue}
  
\begin{dialogue}{Merchant}
How much?
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sophie gives 50 coins to the merchant.

\begin{screenplay}

\begin{dialogue}[annoyed]{Merchant}
It’s not enough. Don’t waste my time!\\
\end{dialogue}

    Sophie goes away disconsolate.
    
\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
I saw on the map there is another square in front of the castle, maybe we'll have better luck there.
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}

  \item Sophie gives 100 coins to the merchant.
    
\begin{screenplay}

\begin{dialogue}{Merchant}
Well I don't know much about any wizard from Ingary. After the prince Justin has been imprisoned ...
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[incredulous]{Sophie}
Wait, wait, wait! What? Justin has been imprisoned?!
\end{dialogue}
    
\begin{dialogue}{Merchant}
Yes, he tried to persuade the queen to end the war and he has been accused of high treason.
\end{dialogue}
    
\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Really? And where is he now?
\end{dialogue}
    
\begin{dialogue}{Merchant}
Obviously, in the prison of the castle. But be careful! The castle is surveilled everywhere by many guards. If you really wanna get in, maybe you should try on the west entrance. %, except for the west wall because they think it is too high for anyone, but, maybe, not for you...
\end{dialogue}
    
\begin{dialogue}[hasty]{Sophie}
Okay, okay thank you! I have to go!
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}

\begin{dialogue}{Can \#{}2}
Howl?
\end{dialogue}

Sorry, we don’t know any Howl.

Some days ago we heard two guards talking about a powerful wizard.

The spirits realm.

Sophie and Calcifer follow the indication of the objects and they reach the guards locker room. On the wall there is an old and rusty torch. There is a door and a small window that allows them to see a guard and a demon behind the door.

\textit{\textbf{CHOICE}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Puzzle}
  
\begin{screenplay}
\intslug[afternoon]{Castle of Dynamia, ground floor, guards locker room}

\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Ssh. Please, I need to find a friend.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[determined]{Torch \#{}1}
No, lady. No favors. If you want to pass, you must solve my puzzle.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sophie and Calcifer reach a corridor patrolled by one guard and two demons.

\textbf{Sophie}: I think we can evade them if we hide in the rooms.

\textit{\textbf{CHOICE}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Puzzle}
  
  They hide in the rooms, they wait for the enemies to move on, and then they move on until they reach the end of the corridor. The stairs are locked, so they solve another puzzle and use the secret passage.
  
  If the enemies come closer, the torch warns Sophie:
  
  \textbf{Torch \#{}2 (in a very polite way)}: Excuse me, miss, the guards are approaching.
  
  Sophie and Calcifer cannot hide in a room because the door is too far, but they can hide behind the nearby box.

  \item \textbf{Fight}
  
  Sophie and Calcifer defeat the enemies and they take the key to unlock the stairs, then they go downstairs.

\textit{\textbf{CHOICE}}

Oh, no. He's terrifying.

\begin{dialogue}[at low voice]{Calcifer}
Sophie, look! That door!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[worried]{Justin}
Damn, where are all the boats?!
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{Sophie}
Calcifer, use those debris to build a boat.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}[scared]{Calcifer}

Ok! Ok! Just stay still! We'll turn around!
\end{dialogue}

\end{screenplay}
\vspace{1em}

Sophie guides the Shark machine through the city, careful to avoid the guards and the demons.

They dock near the dead end where is placed the secret passage for the flying castle. They go there and pass through the door.

\subsection{Secondary characters in the level story}
\subsubsection*{Merchant}
The merchant is an old and crippled man with thick glasses who, because of his age and his physical condition, couldn't take part to the war. He was born in Dynamia and he knows the city like the back of his hand. His only interest is making money and so he doesn't care about kings, queens and politics and he definitely hates losing time because \enquote{time is money}.

\subsubsection*{Newsboys}
Newsboys are kids that, typically, live in the ghetto and so they work for some journal or for the queen herself to spread news in the main squares and raise some money for their families. They are easily recognizable due to the fact that their clothes are old and dirty and full of patches.
