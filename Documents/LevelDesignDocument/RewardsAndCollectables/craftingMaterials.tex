\section{Crafting materials}
One of the main components to Sophie's Flying Castle game is finding collectibles throughout the world.
Collectibles are items that are required to be collected in order to achieve 100\%
completion of the game, but they are not compulsorily required to go on in the main storyline. Rewards are offered for collecting certain numbers of each
collectible, and each individual collectible gives a small cash reward once picked up. Collectables are hats and clothes that Sophie
can wear during the game.
