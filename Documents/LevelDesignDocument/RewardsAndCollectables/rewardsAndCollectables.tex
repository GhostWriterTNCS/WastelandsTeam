\section{Rewards and collectables}
One of the main components to Sophie's Flying Castle game is finding collectables throughout the world.
Collectables are items that are required to be collected in order to achieve 100\%
completion of the game, but they are not compulsorily required to go on in the main storyline. Collectables, along with coins and crafting materials, are the fundamental part of the reward system of the game; in fact they constitute the prizes for any successful in-game action of the player. Moreover they event grant rewards to all the players who will deeply explore the maps, reaching high percentages of completion of the game.

\subsection{Collectables of levels}
These collectables are items that Sophie is granted to receive during the levels. These are tided to a small reward in coins, materials or experience and binded to levels of Sophie's abilities. The player will receive these items just by playing the main story of the game.

\subsection{Hidden collectables and trophies}
These collectables are items that Sophie will have to find within the different levels of the game. These are tided to a medium/big reward in coins, materials or experience and binded to levels of Sophie's abilities. In order to receive them the player has to play the game deeply, exploring areas outside the ones he encountered during the main story flow, investing more time to get higher rewards.
