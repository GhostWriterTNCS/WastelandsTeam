\section{Rewards and collectables}
One of the main components to Sophie's Flying Castle game is the collectibles throughout the world.
Collectibles are items that are required to be collected in order to achieve 100\%
completion of the game, but are not components of the main storyline. Rewards are offered for collecting certain numbers of each
collectible, and each individual collectible gives a small cash reward once picked up. Collectables are hats and clothes that Sophie
can wear during the game. 

\subsection{Collectables of levels}
These collectables are additionals that Sophie is definitely receiving in the levels. These are tided to a small reward in coins, materials or experience and binded to levels of Sophie's abilities. In order to receive them Sophie simply has to play the game.
