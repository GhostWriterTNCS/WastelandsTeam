\section{Rewards and collectables}
One of the main components to Sophie's Flying Castle game is finding collectibles throughout the world.
Collectibles are items that are required to be collected in order to achieve 100\%
completion of the game, but they are not compulsorily required to go on in the main storyline. Collectibles, along with coins and crafting materials, are the fundamental part of the reward system of the game; in fact they constitute the prizes for any successful in-game action of the player. Moreover they event grant rewards to all the players who will deeply explore the maps, reaching high percentages of completion of the game.\\

There are three category of collectibles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Hats}: these objects can be hats, wigs and helmets. If they are worn they provide skill bonus during the game everywhere Sophie is as long as she keeps on wearing it.
\item \textbf{Lanterns}: these objects are as weapons for Sophie. They contain Calcifer and they are evolutions of the lantern which Sophie starts with. If they are held from Sophie they provide skill bonus during the game everywhere she is as long as she keeps on holding it.
\item \textbf{Clothes}: these object are special clothes that Sophie may get during the game and they provide effect depending where Sophie are.  
  \end{enumerate}

In general, a player can only use one object per category at a time.

Example: if Sophie had unlocked two or more magic hats, she could still wear only one. But if she had unlocked also a magic lantern, she might wear a hat and hold the lantern.

\subsection{Collectables of level}
These collectables are items that Sophie is granted to receive only during the levels. If the player don't get an object in its relative level, he can't get it anymore in the game.

\subsection{Hidden collectables and trophies}
These collectables are not level-dependent and the player could get them in more moments during the game. They are tided to a medium/big reward in coins, materials or experience and binded to levels of Sophie's abilities. In order to receive them the player has to play the game deeply, exploring areas outside the ones he encountered during the main story flow, investing more time to get higher rewards.
