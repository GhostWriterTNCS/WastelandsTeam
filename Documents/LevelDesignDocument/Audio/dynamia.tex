In the whole city there is the sound of the waves, that is more evident when the player is near the sea, and the noises made by the boats, in particular the steam-powered ones.

Sometimes you hear the cry of some seagulls.

\subsection{Harbor area}
The harbor area is the most noisy area of Dynamia. There are the screams of the workers and the noises made by the big boats and the machines.
