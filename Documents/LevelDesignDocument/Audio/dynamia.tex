In the whole city there is the sound of the waves, that is more evident when the player is near the sea or the biggest canals, and the sound of the wind. You can hear the noises made by the boats, in particular the steam-powered ones, and the buzz of the crowd.

There are the noises made by the workers who are carrying goods by hand or by small carts, but they are less common in the central area. They are louder in the harbor area, where there are a lot of busy workers and machines.

Sometimes you hear the cry of some seagulls. Everywhere but in the central area you can hear the noises made by stray dogs and cats.
