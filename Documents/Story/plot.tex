\section{Plot}

\subsection*{Prologue}
Sophie has discovered she is a witch and she is learning how to talk with objects, but she is still a beginner.

Suddenly Suliman sends Howl on a mission in order to understand the reasons why the war between the two kingdoms has not already ceased.

\subsection*{Act 1}
Weeks after Howl's departure, Sophie begins getting worried for him because the war is still going on and they haven't heard from him for three weeks.

She goes visiting Suliman and ask her for some information about Howl and the mission he is carrying on. Suliman tells her that Howl has gone to Dynamia, the capital of Strangia, but she lost communication with him three weeks ago too.

Sophie wants to leave to help Howl, but Suliman discourages her because it is very dangerous. Sophie doesn't care because she cannot stand still while Howl is danger. In order to help Sophie in some way, Suliman gives her a magical ring.

Sophie goes back to the flying castle and tells to her friends what she has discovered.

\subsection*{Act 2}
Sophie puts Calcifer in the magic lantern crafted by Howl and she uses the magic door to reach Dynamia.

While they are roaming through the city they find out that Justin, the prince of Strangia, has been imprisoned by the queen regent because he has come back from Ingary asking to end the war, but he has been thought to be secretly a friend of the king of Ingary and so he has been accused of high treason. They decide to go save him.

Using their abilities, Sophie and Calcifer enter the castle of Dynamia and they reach the prison. They find the brig where Justin is imprisoned and they free him.

The three of them escape from the castle and they get back to the flying castle. They head to the castle of Kingsbury and Justin reveals that the regent is Mizar. Sophie says to Suliman that the objects in the castle of Dynamia told her that Howl is imprisoned in the spirits realm. Suliman is not able to send Sophie to the spirits realm, only djinns can. So Suliman tells Sophie about a legendary old djinn who is told to live in the southern desert.
