\section{Plot}

\subsection*{Prologue}
Sophie has discovered she is a witch and she is learning how to talk with objects, but she is still a beginner.

She happily lives with Howl and their friends in his castle, which flies across Ingary.

Suddenly Suliman, the court magician of Ingary, calls Howl because she needs his help to stop the war. Howl is reluctant, but he feels compelled to accept because he wants to end the conflict and save, in this way, the lives of many innocents.

Before leaving, Howl creates a magic needle for Sophie that she can use to sew magic hats.

\subsection*{Act 1}
Weeks after Howl's departure, Sophie is still training in magic with Markl and the Witch of the Waste. She begins getting worried for Howl because the war is still going on and they haven't heard from him for three weeks.

She decides to go to Kingsbury in order to talk with Suliman and ask her for some information about Howl and the mission he is carrying on. Suliman tells her that Howl has gone to Dynamia, the capital of Strangia, to gather more accurate information about what is happening at the court, but she lost communication with him three weeks ago too.

Sophie wants to leave to help Howl, but Suliman discourages her because Dynamia is the middle of the enemy kingdom. It is the headquarters of the army, so there are a lot of soldiers and wizards, and Suliman is not able to provide help there. Sophie doesn't care because she cannot stand still while Howl is danger. In order to help Sophie in some way, Suliman gives her a magical ring that can protect her from light injuries.

Sophie goes back to the flying castle and tells to her friends what she has discovered. She gets ready to immediately leave with Calcifer towards Dynamia.

\subsection*{Act 2}
Sophie puts Calcifer in the magic lantern crafted by Howl and she uses the magic door to reach Dynamia. They find themselves in a narrow street crossed by a small canal.

While they are roaming through the city they find out that Justin, the prince of Strangia, has been imprisoned by the queen regent because he has come back from Ingary asking to end the war, but he has been thought to be secretly a friend of the king of Ingary and so he has been accused of high treason. Given that Justin is a dear friend of them, they decide to go save him.
