\subsection{General conventions}
During the project development you have to respect the following generic conventions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The name of each file has to begin with a lowercase character. Each time you want to separate two words within a file name, you have not to add a space between them but you have to make the first character of the second word uppercase. If you have more than one version of the file, add an underscore before the file type identifier: \textit{fileNameExample\_type.ext}
  \item The name of each folder has to begin with an uppercase character. Each time you want to separate two words within a directory name, you have not to add a space between them but you have to make the first character of the second word uppercase: \textit{FolderNameExample}
  \item Files named \textit{index.tex} are used as containers, they connect all the other files inside the current directory. Each chapter directory has to contain one.
  %\item Never separate words.
\end{itemize}
